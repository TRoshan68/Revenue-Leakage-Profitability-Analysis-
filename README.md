# Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-Analysis-
This project analyzes revenue leakage and profitability using a multi-year dataset (2020–2025) with 25K+ transactions.
I designed a star schema in SQL Server and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify loss drivers and margin risks.
The analysis reveals how high discounts and returns contribute to profit erosion despite revenue growth.
Time intelligence (YoY, YTD, rolling trends) enables performance tracking and strategic decision support.
Built using SQL Server, Power BI, DAX, and data modeling best practices.

# Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-Analysis-
**Overview**

This project analyzes revenue leakage and profitability trends to identify hidden losses that occur despite revenue growth. Using SQL Server and Power BI, I built a star schema data model and interactive dashboard to uncover loss drivers, evaluate discount strategies, and support data-driven decision-making.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to detect revenue leakage, assess its impact on profitability, and provide actionable insights to improve pricing, operational efficiency, and margin protection.

**Dataset**

25,000+ sales transactions

Multi-year data (2020–2025)

Dimensions: Date, Product, Customer, Region

Metrics: Revenue, Profit, Discounts, Returns, Leakage

**Data Modeling**

Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables

Implemented primary and foreign keys to ensure referential integrity

Enabled multidimensional analysis across time, region, product, and customer segments

**Key Insights**

2022 recorded the highest revenue but also the highest revenue leakage, highlighting the hidden cost of rapid growth.

Discounts above 20% showed a measurable decline in profit margins.

Certain regions and product categories contributed disproportionately to return-related losses.

Consumer segment exhibited higher return rates compared to corporate clients.

**Business Impact**

This analysis demonstrates how organizations can:

Identify and reduce revenue leakage

Optimize discount strategies to protect margins

Improve operational processes to reduce returns

Focus on high-margin products and segments

**Dashboard Features**

Executive overview with revenue, profit, margin, and leakage KPIs

Leakage analysis by product, region, and discount levels

Time intelligence (YoY, YTD, rolling trends) for performance tracking

Interactive slicers and bookmarks for dynamic exploration

**Tools & Skills Used**

SQL Server – Data modeling and query optimization

Power BI – Dashboard development and visualization

DAX – KPI calculations and time intelligence

Star Schema Design – Scalable data modeling

Business Analysis – Insight generation and recommendations

**Project Outcome**

This project strengthened my ability to transform raw transactional data into strategic insights, demonstrating how data analytics can support profitability, risk management, and operational efficiency.

**Future Enhancements**

Predictive modeling for return probability

What-if analysis for discount optimization

Integration with real-time sales data

**Feedback Welcome**

I welcome suggestions on additional metrics, modeling improvements, or analytical approaches to further enhance this revenue leakage analysis.
